7:T4ee, If GoodStandingAI in the future has affiliates or subsidiaries, your data may be shared within our controlled group of companies for the purposes described (for example, if we establish a subsidiary in another region to assist in providing support or development). Any such entity will uphold the same privacy protections. Additionally, your information may be accessed by our limited authorized personnel (employees or contractors) who have a legitimate need to access it to perform their duties (such as technical support, data migration assistance, or system administration). All GoodStandingAI personnel with access to personal or sensitive data are bound by strict confidentiality obligations (including NDAs and internal policies), undergo training on data protection, and are subject to discipline (including termination and legal consequences) if they misuse data. We follow the principle of least privilege, meaning staff can only access the minimum data necessary for their task, and any access to customer content (like viewing a document you uploaded) would only occur with your authorization (for example, if you ask our support team to help troubleshoot an issue in a specific document, and even then, we limit what is viewed and log such access).8:T5cd,, you can delete certain data through the app, and you can ask us to delete personal data we hold. If you are a direct customer and wish to delete your account and all associated data, you can contact support and we will guide you through that process (which may involve verification steps for security). If you are an individual whose information is in a customer's minute book (for example, you are a director in a corporation that our customer manages through GoodStandingAI) and you want your personal data removed, you will likely need to request the law firm to remove or update your information in their records, as they are the controller of that data. However, if such a request is communicated to us (either by you or by our customer), we will assist in deleting or anonymizing your data in our system as appropriate. Please note that certain data cannot be deleted if we are required to keep it by law or if it is essential to continuing to provide the service you still want (for instance, we cannot delete your login credentials while your account remains active, and a law firm cannot ask us to delete all data about a client's company while still expecting to maintain that company's records on the platform – they would need to remove the company entirely). We will explain any exceptions if they apply. There is no charge for deletion requests, and we do not discriminate in providing our service based on exercising these rights (see CCPA Non-Discrimination below).0:{"P":null,"b":"HGQW-6ZvIa0UQ39W1XgOB","p":"","c":["","privacy",""],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["privacy",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/d1fc83feb4c0b092.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","link","1",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/73e8eba94528acd2.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","itemScope":true,"itemType":"https://schema.org/WebApplication","children":[["$","head",null,{"children":[["$","meta",null,{"name":"next-router-prefetch","content":"false"}],["$","$L2",null,{"id":"organization-schema","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"GoodStandingAI Inc.\",\"url\":\"https://goodstandingai.com\",\"logo\":\"https://goodstandingai.com/images/logo/logo-light-transparent.png\",\"foundingLocation\":{\"@type\":\"Place\",\"name\":\"Canada\"},\"areaServed\":[{\"@type\":\"Country\",\"name\":\"Canada\"},{\"@type\":\"Place\",\"name\":\"North America\"}],\"contactPoint\":{\"@type\":\"ContactPoint\",\"contactType\":\"customer service\",\"availableLanguage\":[\"English\",\"French\"]}}"}}],["$","$L2",null,{"id":"software-schema","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"SoftwareApplication\",\"name\":\"GoodStandingAI Platform\",\"applicationCategory\":\"LegalComplianceSoftware\",\"operatingSystem\":\"Web\",\"offers\":{\"@type\":\"Offer\",\"price\":\"0\",\"priceCurrency\":\"CAD\",\"description\":\"Free tier available\"},\"featureList\":[\"Digital Minute Books\",\"Annual Return Automation\",\"Compliance Monitoring\",\"AI-Powered Assistance\",\"Document Generation\"],\"audience\":{\"@type\":\"Audience\",\"audienceType\":\"LegalProfessional\"}}"}}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"icon","href":"/favicon.ico","sizes":"any"}],["$","$L2",null,{"src":"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-6SS4DKNV9J","strategy":"afterInteractive"}],["$","$L2",null,{"id":"google-analytics","strategy":"afterInteractive","children":"\n            window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n            function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n            gtag('js', new Date());\n            gtag('config', 'G-6SS4DKNV9J');\n          "}]]}],["$","body",null,{"className":"__variable_bccda6 __variable_580fd3 antialiased mobile-safe","children":[["$","$L3",null,{}],["$","main",null,{"className":"pt-11 mobile-safe","id":"main-content","children":["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}],["$","footer",null,{"className":"bg-gray-200 text-gray-600","role":"contentinfo","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 py-6","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-8","children":["$","ol",null,{"className":"space-y-2 text-xs text-gray-700 list-decimal list-inside","children":[["$","li",null,{"children":["GoodStandingAI is a legal technology company, ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"not a law firm"}],".
